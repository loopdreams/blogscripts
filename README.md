# blogscripts
Collection of personal scripts for automating blog workflow. These scripts only work with my current, personalised setup.

## Scripts

### Compiling the blog/gemlog

- blog_publish: calls all the other scripts when I want to publish/push a blog.
- blog_blop: By drew/uoou/friendo. The main script for compiling the website. Generates html from a markdown folder.
- blog_gemindex: By Fixato. Generates a Gemlog index page from a folder of .gmi files.
- blog_gemindexmake: just runs the above script, deletes previous index.gmi so it isn't included in the new output

### Additional

- gemfeed.py: script by Solderpunk to generate a gemini atom feed
